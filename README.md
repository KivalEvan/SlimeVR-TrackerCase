## Print Settings

Only tested with FDM printer; no support needed, any default quality works fine.

## Original Intent

I didn't find existing community case to fit my build case and components used often don't fit well. Red's case design is almost perfect but it had quirks and barely fit. So I made my own to solve the problem, hope you find this helpful too.
